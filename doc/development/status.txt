This is an experimental project.

Here are the basics to how this would work:

tk-uw/toolkit/kpcore/kdph.py

This script will be autogenerated in the installation process.

We'll assume that it already exists when writing the code to wrap it with ToolKit itself.

---

Toolkit aims to be a system level package manager using the engine at Knexyce/kdph to manage software for any major OS.

The idea is that toolkit internally uses KDPH for operations that are wrapped by core/local and core/github, while adding custom features in core/custom.

More information will be added later.
